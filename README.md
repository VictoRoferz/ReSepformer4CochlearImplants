# ReSepformer4CochlearImplants
The project is about to apply a modified and optimized form of the ReSepformer Transformer architecture to data sets for speech enhancement and speech seperation in cochlear implants. Finally, use some quantization techniques in order to get the model to work on an edge device as a cochlear inplant.
